      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>establish and explore the stages of children’s brain development</li>
  <li>explore the impact of brain development on children’s holistic development</li>
  <li>examine the connection between brain development and children’s learning</li>
  <li>define and evaluate the importance of effective relationships</li>

  <p class="govuk-body">From birth to 5 years old, a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life.
Brain development is a long process. The brain starts to develop around 2 weeks after conception and continues into adulthood.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">It's important to understand developmental patterns and factors that can affect a child’s development. Both genetic and environmental factors impact on brain development.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Brain development is integral to a child’s ability to develop their language skills. As communication and language will underpin all other areas of development, it is essential that we promote both brain and communication development.</p>
